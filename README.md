# Note Taker

## Description

A web application that saves and stores notes using a json file. When you click the save icon in the top right, it will send a POST request that stores your note into the db.json file. On each page load, the site sends a GET request that takes data from the db.json and then displays it as notes on the page. 

## User Story

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
